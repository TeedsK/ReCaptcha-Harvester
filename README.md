# ReCaptcha-Harvester
> An example of a ReCaptcha token harvester.

Easily view a token of a completed ReCaptcha V2

# What does this do?
This allows a user to save a passed ReCaptcha and save the token in order to avoid re-taking another ReCaptcha later on.<br/>
This can be useful for bypassing security systems that use ReCaptcha as a robot could simply input a previously solved captcha rather than being stuck and unnable to solve.

*Notice, this only works on the example website at the moment.*
